@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\fpga_led_tm1637\src\led_tm1637.v":90:0:90:5|Found inferred clock LED_TM1637|clk_50M[0] which controls 19 sequential elements including clk_led_0[0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
